# KMeans_HotelSelection

This project is to define an algorithm that takes in a set of Latitude and Longitude coordinates for hotels and attractions and returns the hotels closest to the user’s preferred attractions, it would help travelers choose hotels by finding which hotels are closest to the types of attractions they’re most interested in.

Main question  
● What hotels in a tourist destination are closest to different types of attractions so that travelers can find hotels that are close to many attractions that are desired by that traveler?  
● How can we make clusters using an algorithm that efficiently clusters hotels and attractions together?  
● How can we define how many clusters is the right amount to use? Should it vary based on the number of attractions? Or vary based on how far a particular traveler is willing to be away from attractions? Based on how far a traveler would want to be away from attractions, we could have many small clusters or a few large clusters?
